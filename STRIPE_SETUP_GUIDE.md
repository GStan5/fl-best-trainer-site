# üöÄ Stripe Setup Guide for FL's Best Personal Trainer

This guide will walk you through setting up Stripe for your fitness platform step-by-step.

## üìã Prerequisites

- You have created a Stripe account at https://dashboard.stripe.com
- You have access to your project's `.env.local` file

---

## üîë Step 1: Get Your Stripe API Keys

### 1.1 Login to Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. Login with your Stripe account credentials

### 1.2 Make Sure You're in Test Mode

1. **IMPORTANT**: In the top-left corner, you'll see a toggle switch
2. Make sure it says **"Test mode"** (not "Live mode")
3. The toggle should be **ON** (blue) for testing
4. This ensures you won't charge real money during development

### 1.3 Navigate to API Keys

1. In the left sidebar, click **"Developers"**
2. Click **"API keys"** from the dropdown menu
3. You should now see your API keys page

### 1.4 Copy Your Keys

You'll see two types of keys:

#### Publishable Key

- Starts with `pk_test_`
- This is **safe to expose** in your frontend code
- Click **"Reveal test key"** if it's hidden
- **Copy this entire key** (including `pk_test_`)

#### Secret Key

- Starts with `sk_test_`
- This is **SENSITIVE** - never expose this in frontend code
- Click **"Reveal test key"** if it's hidden
- **Copy this entire key** (including `sk_test_`)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Add Keys to Your Environment File

### 2.1 Open Your Project

1. Navigate to your project folder: `C:\Users\Gavin\Desktop\fl-best-trainer-site`
2. Look for a file called `.env.local`
3. If it doesn't exist, create a new file called `.env.local`

### 2.2 Add Your Stripe Keys

Add these lines to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE

# Your domain for redirects
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
```

### 2.3 Replace the Placeholders

- Replace `pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE` with your actual publishable key
- Replace `sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE` with your actual secret key

**Example of what it should look like:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_51234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=http://localhost:3001
```

## üîó Step 3: Set Up Webhook (For Production Later)

_Note: You can skip this step for now if you're just testing. This is needed when you go live._

### 3.1 Create Webhook Endpoint

1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to **"Developers"** ‚Üí **"Webhooks"**
2. Click **"Add endpoint"**
3. Enter your endpoint URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
4. Select these events to listen for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Click **"Add endpoint"**

### 3.2 Get Webhook Secret

1. After creating the webhook, click on it
2. In the **"Signing secret"** section, click **"Reveal"**
3. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
4. Add it to your `.env.local`:

```bash
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

---

## üß™ Step 4: Test Your Integration

### 4.1 Restart Your Development Server

1. Stop your current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
2. Run `npm run dev` again
3. Go to http://localhost:3001/account

### 4.2 Test a Purchase

1. Make sure you're logged in
2. Click on a "Buy" button for any package
3. You'll be redirected to Stripe's checkout page
4. Use Stripe's test card numbers:

#### Test Card Numbers

- **Successful payment**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Declined payment**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Requires authentication**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

#### Test Card Details

- **Expiry**: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
- **CVC**: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
- **Name**: Any name
- **Address**: Any address

### 4.3 What Should Happen

1. ‚úÖ Payment processes successfully
2. ‚úÖ You're redirected back to your account page
3. ‚úÖ Success message appears
4. ‚úÖ Sessions are added to your account
5. ‚úÖ Purchase appears in your purchase history

---

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Stripe is not properly configured"

**Solution**: Make sure your `.env.local` file has the correct variable names and your keys are properly formatted.

### Issue 2: Payment goes through but sessions aren't added

**Solution**: Check that your webhook is working or the success redirect is functioning properly.

### Issue 3: "Invalid API Key"

**Solution**:

- Make sure you copied the entire key including `pk_test_` or `sk_test_`
- Make sure you're in test mode in Stripe dashboard
- Restart your development server after adding keys

### Issue 4: Checkout page doesn't open

**Solution**:

- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure your publishable key is correct
- Ensure you're logged in to the application

---

## üìû Need Help?

If you run into any issues:

1. **Check the browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) for error messages
2. **Check your terminal** where npm run dev is running for server errors
3. **Verify your keys** are correctly copied and pasted
4. **Make sure** you're in Stripe test mode

---

## üîê Security Notes

- ‚úÖ **Never** commit your `.env.local` file to git
- ‚úÖ **Never** share your secret key publicly
- ‚úÖ Always use test mode during development
- ‚úÖ The publishable key is safe to use in frontend code

---

## üöÄ Going Live (When Ready)

When you're ready to accept real payments:

1. Switch to **Live mode** in Stripe Dashboard
2. Get your **live API keys** (they'll start with `pk_live_` and `sk_live_`)
3. Update your `.env.local` with live keys
4. Set up webhooks with your production domain
5. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` to your live domain

---

**üéâ That's it! Your Stripe integration should now be working perfectly.**
