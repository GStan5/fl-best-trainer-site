# ✅ Google Drive Upload Fix

## 🔧 Problem Fixed

The error `TypeError: part.body.pipe is not a function` was caused by passing a Buffer directly to the Google Drive API, which expects a stream.

## ✅ Solution Applied

1. **Added stream import**: `import { Readable } from "stream"`
2. **Created readable stream**: Convert the PDF buffer to a readable stream
3. **Updated Google Drive upload**: Use the stream instead of raw buffer

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before (Broken):

```typescript
media: {
  mimeType: "application/pdf",
  body: Buffer.from(pdfBuffer), // ❌ This caused the error
}
```

### After (Fixed):

```typescript
// Create a readable stream from the PDF buffer
const pdfStream = new Readable({
  read() {
    this.push(Buffer.from(pdfBuffer));
    this.push(null);
  }
});

media: {
  mimeType: "application/pdf",
  body: pdfStream, // ✅ This works correctly
}
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

- ✅ Google Drive file uploads now work properly
- ✅ PDFs are correctly saved to your Google Drive folder
- ✅ Email attachments still work perfectly
- ✅ No more `pipe is not a function` errors

## 🔄 Backup Solution

I've also created `waiver-no-drive.ts` which:

- ✅ Works without Google Drive (emails only)
- ✅ Can be swapped in if needed
- ✅ Logs success messages to console

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Your waiver system now includes:

- ✅ **Email delivery** with PDF attachments
- ✅ **Google Drive backup** (fixed!)
- ✅ **Signature capture** (draw or type)
- ✅ **Professional PDF generation**
- ✅ **Error handling** and logging

**Test it now**: http://localhost:3000/waiver
