# ðŸ”§ Signature Pad Fixed!

## âœ… What Was Fixed

The error `trim_canvas__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_8__ is not a function` was caused by a compatibility issue with the `react-signature-canvas` library.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed** `react-signature-canvas` (problematic library)
2. **Installed** `signature_pad` (stable, well-maintained library)
3. **Updated** the waiver form to use the native `signature_pad` API
4. **Added** proper TypeScript types

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Test

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/waiver
2. **Fill out the form** with your details
3. **Test Draw Signature**:

   - Click "Clear" to test clearing
4. **Test Type Signature**:

5. **Submit the form** and check your email!
